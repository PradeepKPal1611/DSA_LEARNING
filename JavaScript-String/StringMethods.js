/* <== JavaScript String Methods

JavaScript strings are the sequence of characters. In JavaScript, 
strings automatically convert the string to objects so 
that we can use string methods and properties also for 
primitive strings. It is used to represent and manipulate 
the sequence of characters.

In general, there are two ways to create a string in JavaScript. 
Either by using the new String() syntax or putting the 
value in quotes.

Example: This example, creates a string in JavaScript 
using the methods described above. ==> */

let str2 = new String("Welcome Geeks");
 
console.log(str1);
console.log(str2);

/* Output

Welcome to GeesforGeeks
[String: 'Welcome Geeks'] */
